This repository contains **20 basic Python programs** created as part of my learning and assignment work.
These programs help in understanding fundamental Python concepts such as variables, loops, conditions,
lists, strings, and dictionaries.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

1️⃣ Hello World

What it does:
Prints a simple message.

Logic:
Uses print() function to display text.

Explain like this:

“This program prints a message using the print function.”

2️⃣ Add Two Numbers

What it does:
Adds two integers.

Logic:
Store values in variables and add them.

Say:

“I used variables and the addition operator.”

3️⃣ Even or Odd

What it does:
Checks whether a number is even or odd.

Logic:
Uses modulus % operator.

Say:

“If number mod 2 is zero, it’s even.”

4️⃣ Largest of Two Numbers

What it does:
Finds the maximum of two numbers.

Logic:
Uses built-in max() function.

5️⃣ Factorial

What it does:
Calculates factorial of a number.

Logic:
Multiply numbers from 1 to n using a loop.

Say:

“I used a for loop to calculate factorial.”

6️⃣ Fibonacci Series

What it does:
Prints Fibonacci numbers.

Logic:
Each number is sum of previous two.

7️⃣ Reverse a String

What it does:
Reverses a string.

Logic:
Uses slicing [::-1].

8️⃣ Palindrome

What it does:
Checks if a string reads same forward and backward.

Logic:
Compare string with its reverse.

9️⃣ Count Vowels

What it does:
Counts vowels in a string.

Logic:
Loop through characters and check membership.

🔟 Sum of List

What it does:
Finds sum of list elements.

Logic:
Uses sum() function.

1️⃣1️⃣ Maximum in List

What it does:
Finds largest number in a list.

Logic:
Uses max().

1️⃣2️⃣ Prime Number

What it does:
Checks if number is prime.

Logic:
Check divisibility from 2 to n-1.

1️⃣3️⃣ Multiplication Table

What it does:
Prints multiplication table.

Logic:
Uses loop from 1 to 10.

1️⃣4️⃣ Count Digits

What it does:
Counts digits in a number.

Logic:
Convert number to string and find length.

1️⃣5️⃣ Swap Numbers

What it does:
Swaps two values.

Logic:
Uses Python tuple unpacking.

1️⃣6️⃣ Remove Duplicates

What it does:
Removes duplicate elements from list.

Logic:
Convert list to set.

1️⃣7️⃣ Sort List

What it does:
Sorts list in ascending order.

Logic:
Uses sort() method.

1️⃣8️⃣ Dictionary Example

What it does:
Accesses dictionary values.

Logic:
Key-value pair access.

1️⃣9️⃣ String Length Without len()

What it does:
Finds string length manually.

Logic:
Increment counter in loop.

2️⃣0️⃣ Simple Calculator

What it does:
Performs basic arithmetic operations.

Logic:
Uses operators + - * /.
